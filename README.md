This repository supports the following manuscript, which has been submitted for peer-review.

Jiale Shi, Dylan J. Walsh, Nathan J. Rebello, Weizhong Zou, Michael E. Deagen, Katharina A. Fransen, Xian Gao,  Debra J. Audus, Bradley D. Olsen (2023), "Calculating Pairwise Similarity of Polymer Ensembles via Earth Mover’s Distance", ACS Polymer Au, submitted.

In this work, we proposed the [earth mover’s distance (EMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance) method to quantitatively calculate the pairwise similarity score for polymer ensembles.

The repository is intended for the following use cases:

- Illustrate the EMD method for polymer ensemble calculation in the manuscript
- Allow for full reproducibility of the results in the manuscript
